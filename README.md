We sell bricks and thats good

# What we already did:
    - Setup of a MySQL-Server in an docker-compose.yml 
    - Generated a database schema and a data.sql file which has been fed with the required data
    - MySQL-Server gets filled with data when the Spring Application gets started (see application.properties)
